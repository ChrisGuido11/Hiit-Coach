Frontend / backend UX inconsistencies
2.1. Home “Daily WOD” shows AI workout… but runs a static mock workout

Files:

client/src/pages/home.tsx

client/src/pages/workout.tsx

client/src/pages/workout-detail.tsx

client/src/pages/workout-runner.tsx

What backend does:

GET /api/workout/generate (in server/routes.ts) generates a personalized workout using:

profile.skillScore

fitnessLevel

equipment

primaryGoal, secondaryGoals / goalWeights

Chooses framework via pickFrameworkForGoal or explicit ?framework= from Workout Lab.

Returns a GeneratedWorkout with:

framework: "EMOM" | "Tabata" | "AMRAP" | "Circuit"

durationMinutes

difficultyTag

focusLabel

rounds[...] etc.

What the Home screen does:

In home.tsx you’re already calling:

const { data: workout } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["/api/workout/generate"],
  enabled: !!user && !!profile,
});


You show a nice Daily WOD card with:

{workout.focusLabel} HIIT
{workout.durationMinutes} Min • {workout.rounds.length} Exercises • {workout.difficultyTag}


But the Start Workout button links to:

<Link href="/workout">
  <Button>Start Workout</Button>
</Link>


What /workout actually is:

client/src/pages/workout.tsx is a mock, hard-coded timer using:

const WORKOUT = {
  name: "The Gauntlet",
  totalMinutes: 5,
  exercises: [...]
};


No AI, no backend, no personalization, no profile, no skillScore.

Meanwhile:

The real AI workout flow is:

/api/workout/generate → cached under ["/api/workout/generate"]

WorkoutLab uses the same endpoint for framework-specific generation.

workout-detail.tsx and workout-runner.tsx also read the same queryKey.

Resulting UX problem:

The app visually sells: “Daily AI workout tailored to you.”

But the main CTA (Start Workout on Home + Timer tab /workout) runs a demo workout that ignores AI, profile, and history.

The true AI-powered runner (/workout-detail + /workout/runner) is basically hidden / unused in the real flow.

This is the biggest UX mismatch: backend is doing smart AI stuff, but the main button is wired to a static toy.
